Inspired by
[PubNub-Rickshaw-Memory](https://github.com/pubnub/pubnub-rickshaw-memory), this plugin displays a realtime graph of your NodeJS memory profile over time. It uses socket.io for pushing data to the browser and Shutterstock's [Rickshaw](https://github.com/shutterstock/rickshaw) library for graphing it.
